How to View and Run My DT:
To run the DT, open Deline_Zent_A1_Part2 in a Jupyter Notebook environment and press run-all. 

Additionally, here are some screenshots of the visual representation my DT produces which I made in Python and the metrics my decision tree produces compared to scikit learn on the same dataset. You can see my tree performed much better than the sklearn decision tree, such that my accuracy is 90% while sklearn had a 75% accuracy, my precision was 96% compared to sklearn's 75%,  and my recall was 80% compared to sklearn's 63%.
