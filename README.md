Assignment 1:

RUN DT
First time through, "run all" to see understand my explainaton answer to 2g. Then to change the tree parameters you can go to the 8th cell in the Jupyter Notebook Deline_Zent_A1_Part2. The decision tree must include a max_depth parameter. Ex: DT(test_set, 5, features, 'Survived')

Finding Files
For Part 1, answer files will be located in the output folder.
For Part 2, answers will be printed and images and object code will be located in the output folder. 

In the Future:
There are many things I wanted to improve my code on, including making it easier for you to run. I ran out of time even though I worked on this day and night for days. I apologize, however, I would definitely have a main next time now that I have worked with Python for the first time. I definitely found this assignment really difficult because of the language barrier but now that I have done it I feel much better about future projects.
