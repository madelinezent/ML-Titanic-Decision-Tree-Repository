Q2. Suppose that the data for analysis includes the attribute age. The age values for the data tuples are (in increasing order) 13, 15, 16, 16, 19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 22, 25, 25, 25, 25, 30, 33, 33, 35, 35, 35, 35, 36, 40, 45, 46, 52, 70. (please copy these values correctly in your input or the calculation will be wrong) (7 points)


(a) What is the mean of the data? What is the median?
Mean: 29.962962962962962
Median: 25

(b) What is the mode of the data? Comment on the data's modality (i.e., bimodal, trimodal, etc.). 
25 and 35. The data is bimodal.

(c) What is the midrange of the data?
41.5

(d) Can you find (roughly) the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data?
q1: 20
q3: 35

(e) Give the five-number summary of the data.
{minimum=13, q1=20, median=25, q3=35, maximum=70}

(f) Show a boxplot of the data.
May view in the Jupyter Notebook after cell 5 or at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_Jr6bF5jV-iQpHTJMRNIxVsJmEZrxxr/view?usp=sharing.

(g) How is a quantile-quantile plot different from a quantile plot?
Quantile plots s directly display the quantiles of a set of values, whereas, quantile-quantile plots allow us to compare the quantiles of two sets of numbers.
